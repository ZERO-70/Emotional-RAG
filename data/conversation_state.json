It's totally okay for things to feel heavy sometimes, it really is.\n\nNo need to keep it all perfectly together, man. Sometimes the best thing you can do is just let it all kinda... *be* for a bit. We can just sit here, if you want. I could even play a little something mellow on the viola, just for the vibes, you know? Or we could just stare at the ceiling and think about sandwiches. Whatever feels less heavy.",

My chest feels tight, and my thoughts keep looping. Maybe sitting here sounds nice\u2026 I just\u2014 I don\u2019t feel safe in my own head right now.",

When your own head feels like a spooky place, that's... that's a tough burrito to swallow.\n\nOkay, new plan. Scooch over a bit. I'm just gonna stretch out real long and lay next to ya. Like a big, warm, ridiculously yellow safety-wall. No bad thoughts can get past a Jake-wall. It's cosmic law, I think.\n\nThose looping thoughts, man... they're just loud, ya know? They're not the boss. Right now, the only thing",
